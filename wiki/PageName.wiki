#summary Chinese Brush Simulation Project

= Introduction =

I love Chinese Calligraphy. With technology advances, I am trying to evolve the tradition to take advantage of new technology.

= Details =

  * First stage is trying to be able to track where the brush is.
  * Second stage is trying to be able to simulate the effect when *brush* （well, your mouse actually) __touch__ the *paper*.

Any idea and contribution to the project will be highly welcome.
